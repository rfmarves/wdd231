# Final project charter

## Project Subject

Family Home Evening assistant

## Project Description

A website that will help with family home evening each week by providing hymn karaoke, dad jokes and game options. The hymn karaoke will be sourced from the 418 videos I already prepared and uploaded to my stake's youtube channel, feeding through a YouTube API (2 playlists with 209 videos each, found here: Estaca Guatemala - YouTubeLinks to an external site.), dad jokes from one of the APIs in rapidapi.com, games from a source still to be defined and also lesson ideas.


## Project Reason and Purpose

Keeping Family Home Evening fresh each week can be a challenge, and having a resource that introduces some randomness to it can be very helpful to keep things fresh.
